    <font size = "5">My partner Devon and I created a colorful stereo set using turtle methods to combine various shapes into our homegeneous artifact. We implemented python conditional statements and while loops to make our program user-interactive and to make our simulation more accessible and efficient. It shows moving music notes after asking the user if they would like to play music.</font><br />

    <br>
    <font size = "5">My partner Mohnish and I created a game where the snake (the square) can move using particular keys in order to eat its food (the circle) and grow bigger in size. We allowed for much user input and lots of movement by manipulating strings, list indexing, and a number of ways of abstraction to make it fun and easy for the user.</font><br />

    <br>
    <font size = "5">My partner Natalie and I created an interactive quiz where you answer questions and find out what kind of puppy you are! In support of the patients and staff of the children's hospital, our captivating use of color and movement allows to easy and fun user accessibility while using iteration, functions, lists, strings, and existing turtle methods.</font><br />

    <br>
    <font size = "5"> My partner Natalie and I created a two-player car racing game in Scratch (not remixed) in which we implemented lap counters, multiple racing track backgrounds, different car bodies (costumes), and more. For the yellow car, one would use the left and right arrow keys to move; for the red car, the "a" and "d" keys were used to move left and right.
